# Tower-of-Hanoi-Algorithm

The iterative implementation of Tower of Hanoi. 
I choosed to implement the algorithm in a iterative way to can have a better time complexity than the recursive way.
 
Time complexity:
- Recursive: O(2^n)
- Iterative: O(n)

The puzzle has the following two rules:
- You canâ€™t place a larger disk onto a smaller disk 
- Only one disk can be moved at a time

So I implemented a comand line version in C# to exemplify the moves made to solve this puzzle.
In the line you will see the movement of each individual disk.
